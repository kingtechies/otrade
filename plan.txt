i want to build a trading bot 


but this is the plan


first we are to self host mt5 or mt4

so we use code to execute mt5 or mt4


the brain of the bot is openai api.


also write 5 top stragies, so the bot follows the stragies only


so, the the bot will login the live account of my exness from .env

so it will login the account on mt5 that is self hosted, and can read the tradde in real time and excute in real time

also i can put the bankroll i mean the amount and then the target

let me say i tell the bot that trade $10 trade it to 3month,

so the bot will trade it exute take profit , re-enter market and all that and make sure it reach target,

also create a model that learn the market as it trade
so with that it will make it exceptional good in that market.

but this bot is endless so it run for ever

and this is real time trade
